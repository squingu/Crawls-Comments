#Crawls Comments bot for giveaways

The endgoal for this reddit bot is to save all comments from a predefined submission into a text file. A spreadsheet can be then created from the file for easy filtering and finding a specific submission.

#Updates
```
v0.1 - Bot fetches all comments from a submission, including those behind the 200 comment limit and the displayed nested comment limit. For now it only prints the comment tree into the console.
```
